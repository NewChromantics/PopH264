/**
 * @defgroup LibargusAPI Libargus Camera API
 *
 * Libargus is an API for acquiring images and associated metadata from cameras.
 * The fundamental libargus operation is a capture:
 * acquiring an image from a sensor and processing it into a final output image.
 *
 * Currently, libargus is supported on Android and L4T on NVIDIA Tegra TX1-based platforms.
 *
 * Libargus is designed to address a number of fundamental requirements:
 *
 * - Support for a wide variety of use cases (traditional photography, computational photography,
 * video, computer vision, and other application areas.)
 * To this end, libargus is a frame-based API; every capture is triggered by an explicit request that
 * specifies exactly how the capture is to be performed.
 *
 * - Support for multiple platforms, including L4T and Android.
 *
 * - Efficient and simple integration into applications and larger frameworks.  In support of this,
 * libargus delivers images with EGLStreams, which are directly supported by other system components
 * such as OpenGL and Cuda, and which require no buffer copies during delivery to the consumer.
 *
 * - Expansive metadata along with each output image.
 *
 * - Support for multiple sensors, including both separate control over independent sensors and
 * access to synchronized multi-sensor configurations.  (The latter are unsupported in the current
 * release. When support is added, it will be available on only some NVIDIA platforms.)
 *
 * - Version stability and extensibility, which are provided by unchanging virtual interfaces and
 * the ability for vendors to add specialized extension interfaces.
 *
 * Libargus provides functionality in a number of different areas:
 *
 * - Captures with a wide variety of settings.
 *
 * - Optional autocontrol (such as auto-exposure and auto-white-balance.)
 *
 * - Libraries that consume the EGLStream outputs in different ways; for example, jpeg encoding or
 * direct application access to the images.
 *
 * - Metadata delivery via both libargus events and EGLStream metadata.
 *
 * - Image post-processing such as noise reduction and edge sharpening.
 *
 * - Notification of errors, image acquisition start, and other events via synchronous event queues.
 *
 * Functionality not provided by libargus:
 *
 * - Auto-focus. (Planned to be added in a later release.)
 *
 * - Reprocessing of YUV images (such as that required by Android’s Zero Shutter Lag feature.)
 *
 * - Reprocessing of Bayer (raw) images.  (Planned to be added in a later release.)
 *
 * - Output of Bayer (raw) images.  (Planned to be added in a later release.)
 *
 * @defgroup ArgusObjects Objects and Interfaces
 * This module provides a list of libargus objects and the interfaces that they support.
 * Children of objects in this list describe either child InterfaceProviders provided by
 * the object or specialized types of the object (ie. Event types).
 * @ingroup LibargusAPI
 *
 * @defgroup ArgusExtensions Extensions
 * This module provides a list of extensions currently available for libargus.
